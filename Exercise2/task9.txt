pseudocode for an alarm clock

Ask the user for current time (or use device time)
and for the time they would like to set the alarm for.
The alarm will then ring at said time.

define current time(hours, minutes):
    device current time OR 
    user input(current_time)

define set alarm time(hours, minutes):
    if alarm is set off
        user input(set alarm time)
        alarm on
    else:
        alarm off
    

define main script
    check device time
    check set alarm time
    if device time is set alarm time
        sound the alarm
    else:
        check again
